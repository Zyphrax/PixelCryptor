# PixelCryptor 
File encryption using images as a password.

### A long time ago, in a kingdom far far away...
...where privacy is getting more important daily, the need for secure data sharing is bigger than ever.
PixelCryptor satisfies this need by providing an easy-to-use interface via which you can encrypt and decrypt data
using an image only known by the sender and the receiver.
